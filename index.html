                <p class="about-me">I was always around tech. I grew up with a best friend whose father worked at NASA.  I was playing with computers, 
                                    when most kids were begging for an Atari.  I was always around tech. In the 90's I was the "Can you come check out my
                                    computer" guy.  Everything wasn't always plug and play, I hope you youngsters appreciate just having to put "the purple 
                                    thing in the purple hole"!  I was always around tech.  It seemed like every other day I was fixing someone's monitor or 
                                    printer.  I was always around tech. Today it's the same thing, only replace monitors and printers with setting up iphones,
                                    or *gasp* jailbreaking Firesticks.  I was always around tech.  I spent countless hours of my teen years writing and rewriting 
                                    macros for Ultima Online and Asheron's Call.  I was always around tech.  I spent more time playing with the HTML on my Myspace 
                                    than I did actually socializing on it. I was always around tech, I was just too dumb to turn it into a career. Not. Anymore!  
                                    When I graduated from this bootcamp, I'm going to find a job.  I know this, because I believe in myself.  I know this, because
                                    of the feeling I have every day when I return home to my wife, and she has to ask me to be quiet ... I just can't stop talking
                                    about everything I learned, still want to learn, and need to reasearch that evening.  I can't describe why I know I am on the
                                    right path.  You can't describe a feeling.  It's a feeling I've been missing for a long time, and I'm not going to let it go.
                                    I will always be around tech.
